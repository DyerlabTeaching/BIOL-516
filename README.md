# ENVS 516: Population Genetics

> Semester course; 3 lecture hours. 3 credits. Prerequisite: [STAT/BIOS 543](https://bulletin.vcu.edu/search/?P=STAT%20543). Theoretical and empirical analyses of how demographic and evolutionary processes influence neutral and adaptive genetic variation within populations.

## Introduction
Population genetics is concerned with understanding the mechanisms influencing the movement of genetic mate- rial through both space and time. In order to understand the operation of evolution itself you must have a working knowledge of population genetics. It is, so to speak, where the rubber meets the road and the concepts con- tained with in the field of population genetics have relevance to other sub-disciplines such as population biology, population ecology, evolutionary biology, evolutionary ecology, conservation genetics, landscape genetics, and forensic science.

The field of population genetics has a history punctuated with periods of intense interest interspersed with periods of mind numbing stagnation. Despite, or perhaps due to, the isochronal development in the theory underlying this field, the foundations laid down by Fisher, Haldane, and Wright during the early decades of the 20th century continue to influence empirical validation.

## Workflows in Population Genetics

To understand data analysis in population genetics, we should recognize a generic iterative workflow, such as the one depicted below.

Collect: Getting data from an external source into a format that you can use is often the most time-consuming step in the analysis. The content of this class will provide training in data import from local, online, and database sources.
Visualize: Visualizing data is key to understanding. In the image below, notice that the variables X and Y in all the displayed data sets have equivalent means, standard deviations, and correlation up to 2 decimal places! We will emphasize visualization, both static and dynamic, throughout this class.
Transform: Pulling data into your analysis ecosystem is not sufficient. Often the data need to be reformatted and reconfigured before it is actually usable.
Model: The application of models to subsets of data is often the step that takes the least amount of time and effort. However, the application of a model to data is not the endpoint. The model must be visualized and, many times, the underlying data or derivate data must be transformed and submitted to subsequent models.
Communicate: The effort we put into research and analyses is meaningless without effective communication of your data and findings to a broad audience. Here we will focus on how to develop effective data communication strategies and formats.

## Course Learning Objectives

The purpose of this course is to help you build your data skills and to develop a foundational understanding upon which subsequent courses will build. The overarching goal here is to develop a working knowledge of the R statistical computing language and enough proficiency to import raw data and then iterate through the visualization, manipulation, and analysis steps in the creation of output that is easily communicated to a scientific audience.

The content of this course is built upon the following general student learning objectives (SLO):

- SLO 1: Identify, manipulate, and summarize data associated with population genetic studies.
- SLO 2: Identify and explain how microevolutionary processes impact genetic structure and diversity
- SLO 3: Create an informative and effective graphical display of various data types of suitable quality for inclusion in published manuscripts.
- SLO 4: Effectively choose appropriate statistical models based on the types of data at hand and the questions being addressed.
- SLO 5: Demonstrate a general understanding of spatial data types and the creation of both appropriate static and dynamic maps.
